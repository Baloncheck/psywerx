How to get the site working on your localhost?

You'll need python + django and an SQL database

1. run "git clone git@github.com:Smotko/passwords.git"
2. edit settings.py and configure your database, run "python manage.py syncdb" -- this will create the needed tables in your db
3. run "python manage.py runserver" and point your browser to http://localhost:8000/

Have fun :)
